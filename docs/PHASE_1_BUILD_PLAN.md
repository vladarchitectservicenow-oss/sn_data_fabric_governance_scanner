# PHASE 1: Build Plan

## Data Fabric Governance Scanner

**Repository:** sn_data_fabric_governance_scanner
**Scope Prefix:** x_data_fabric_governance
**License:** MIT

---

## 1. Objective

Build a production-ready ServiceNow scoped application that scans servicenow workflow data fabric configurations for governance violations, schema inconsistencies, and orphaned data products, ensuring enterprise data governance compliance.. The application must be installable on any Australia-era ServiceNow instance and must pass automated functional tests with zero external runtime dependencies.

## 2. Scope

- Scoped application XML metadata
- Core tables (audit, configuration, runtime data)
- Script Includes for business logic
- Business Rules for data integrity and automation
- Scheduled Jobs for recurring operations
- UI Modules and dashboard components
- Self-contained unit tests (Node.js mocks)
- Documentation (README > 2000 words, LICENSE, phase reports)
- Marketing collateral (whitepaper and social media post)

## 3. Out of Scope

- Production PDI deployment (dev/test only)
- ServiceNow Store publishing (future phase)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines (future phase)
- Multi-language localization (English only for v1.0.0)

## 4. Deliverables

| ID | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Application metadata and table schema | Valid scoped app XML, tables create successfully |
| 2 | Script Includes | All core logic in server-side JS, JSDoc comments |
| 3 | Business Rules | Enforce data integrity, auto-link records |
| 4 | Scheduled Jobs | Weekly full scan, nightly incremental scan |
| 5 | Tests | Node.js mocks, all tests pass with `npm test` |
| 6 | README | >2000 words, covers features, architecture, usage |
| 7 | LICENSE | MIT License |
| 8 | Phase docs | This PHASE_1_BUILD_PLAN.md and PHASE_2_BUILD_REPORT.md |
| 9 | Marketing | WHITEPAPER.md + LINKEDIN_POST.md |

## 5. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Design and schema | 1 day | Complete |
| Core logic development | 2 days | Complete |
| Testing and QA | 1 day | Complete |
| Documentation | 1 day | Complete |
| GitHub push and verification | 1 day | Complete |

## 6. Dependencies

- ServiceNow Australia release API documentation
- Node.js 18+ (for local test runner)
- Git with stored credentials for `vladarchitectservicenow-oss`

## 7. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API deprecation after build | Low | High | Regular rule engine updates |
| PDI unavailability | Medium | Medium | Tests run completely offline with mocks |
| Context saturation during generation | Medium | Low | Thread isolation per product |
